6.Statically typed:At compile time, source code in a specific programming language is converted to a machine-readable format. This means that before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single variable must be known.Some common examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Java, Haskell, C, C++, C#, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Go, Pascal, and Swift. 
 Dynamically:This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing. Some examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua.

(7.1) Null on the other hand is a situation where a variable is asigned empty value eg,var name=""
